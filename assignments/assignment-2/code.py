# 1. you have to create one supervisor node.
# 2. create one router function
# 3. create three more node
# 3.1 llm call (llm node)
# 3.2 RAG (rag node)
# 3.3 web crawler(fetch the info in realtime from internet)
# 4. created one more node after this for validation for generated output --> explore the validation part how to do that
# 5. if validation going to be failed in that case again go to supervioser node and then supervisor node will again decide what needs to be call next
# 6. once the validation will pass then only generate the final output
